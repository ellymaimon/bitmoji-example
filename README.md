# Bitmoji Tutorial

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizes [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) as a UI kit. [SnapKit](https://kit.snapchat.com/portal/apps) is used to implement the Bitmoji Sticker Picker.

## Running the Project

To run this project, please add a _.env.local_ file to the root folder of the repository and add the following keys: 
- `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`
- `REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URL`

The value of these keys will be acquired from your own [SnapKit](https://kit.snapchat.com/portal/apps) application page in the "Development Environment" and "Redirect URLs" respectively.

Once you have added the environment file and keys, run the following script:

```
npm run start
```

and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
